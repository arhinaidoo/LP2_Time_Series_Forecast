<p style="text-align: center;font-size:22px ;font-weight: bold ; font-family: 'Times New Roman'"> Sales Analysis and Prediction, A Regression Perspective</p>
<H1 style="text-align: center;font-size:30px ; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #00008B"> Project Description</H1>Corporation Favorita seeks to be informed  on the stocks of products it should have at a particular point in time by analysing the demand trend of all of its products by consumers by using machine learning model forcast. The regression analysis will use past sales data to identify patterns in demand and develop a model that can accurately forecast future demand. This model will then be used to inform purchasing and stocking decisions, reducing the likelihood of stockouts and overstocking. 


## OBJECTIVE

The goal of this regression analysis is to optimize stock management at Corporation Favorita by accurately predicting demand for products in order to ensure that the right quantity of each product is always in stock.
